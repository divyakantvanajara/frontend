                It was a dark night and was raining heavily and there were strange noises from 
every where and voice of the moaning of jackals could be heard. 
Although there was a bad atmosphere king Vikramaditya did not fear a bit. 
He climbed the tree to bring the corpse down and soon he began to walk with 
the corpse lying on his shoulder. 
The Betaal spoke: "O King , I pity you as you are making untiring efforts 
without relaxing as if you wish to achieve something. Instead of enjoying a 
comfortable sleep in your palace you’re still coming after me” 
King didn’t speak anything because any word from his mouth would keep 
Betaal right back on the tree. 
So Betaal starts his story………. 
Long long ago, Kanchannagar was being ruled by King Chandradeep . His 
daughter was Indumati . Being an only child, the princess was brought up like 
a boy, and given training in the use of arms an warfare. The princes of many 
of the neighbouring kingdoms cherished a desire to marry Indumati, who was, 
extremely beautiful. 
Whenever the king broached the subject of marriage, Indumati said "Yes, 
but... Whoever marries me must be strong and brave. And he must succeed in 
the tests that I give." 
Indumati, then she listed out what kind of tests she was contemplating for her 
suitors. The king was horrified. "Don’t insist on any such test, They’re all 
hazardous. No one will come forward to undergo the tests for fear their life. 
Just forget about them." 
Indumati said, "Don't worry father! All those who said that they love me than 
their life will certainly take these tests.” 
Minister said "If the princess wanted to impose the tests, let her wish be 
carried out"

                The royal announcement about the princess wedding was made stated that the 
suitors would have to take certain tests. The announcement was made in all 
the neighbouring kingdoms. 
When young handicapped man named Kurupshana from Jayanagar heard it. 
His mother died soon after he was born, and his father took a second wife. His 
step mother kept his name Kurupshana, which means ugly looking. His 
stepmother ill-treated him much. It was seldom that he even got a full meal. 
She knew that the boy, with his handicap, would not be much use to her. 
He decided to go to Kanchannagar. Few princes had were there 
Kanchannagar. They were guessing what kind of tests the princess would put 
them through. The time came to announce the details of the tests. The Princess 
Indumati came to the stage and sat next to the king. 
Prime Minister got up from his seat and faced the princely suitors. "Several 
suitors are present here to win the hand of princess Indumati. It is her wish 
that they are put to certain tests and Whoever succeed in the test will qualify 
to wed her. You all can see the wall in front of you. You have to climb the 
wall and jump down into the three- tiered cage of sharp knives. The important 
thing is, while doing so, you must not injure yourself. There should not be a 
single scratch on your body from the blades of the knives." 
Many princes took a good look at the high wall as well as the cage of knives. 
The wall looked too high for them; the cage was placed deep down below; and 
the space between the knives was very small. None dared even to make an 
attempt. As they went back to their seats. 
It looked as though no suitor was willing to take the test. The king regretted 
that his daughter did not accept his advice. Kurupshana was watching all this 
from his seat. Suddenly a thought struck him. After all, people back home, 
were only wishing for his death. If he were to succeed in the test , he stood to 
win the hand of princess So, he decided to try his luck. He left his seat and 
walked up to King Chandradeep. The king was shocked. Princess Indumati, 
too, was in a similar dilemma. She was expecting to be married off to a prince. 
Suddenly a doubt arose in her mind: would this young man be able to 
complete the test. King Chandradeep waited for a moment to know his 
daughter’s decision, and then gave the permission to Kurupshana. Kurupshana 
went up the wall. He then took a good look at the cage and jumped down. He 
landed between the knives arrayed all around on all the three tiers.

                He was 
unscathed! He then walked towards the king and the princess. Kurupshana 
said "Huzoor ! Please don’t worry. I didn’t wish to marry the princess. I had 
only wanted to take a challenge and I know I’ve succeeded. That itself is a big 
reward of my life and I can now face life." He bowed low before the king and 
retreated. 
The Betaal ended his story and asked to Vikramaditya “King! Didn’t 
Kurupshana behave like a 
foolish? If he had no intention of marrying the princess, why did he at all 
decide to undergo the test?” And after having succeeded in the test and 
qualified to wed the princess, why did 
not want to marry her? “ , “If you know the answer and still decide not to 
satisfy me, beware, your head will be blown to pieces!” 
""You are right, Kurupshana was a handicapped young man," said the 
Vikramaditya." He was aware of his handicap that bothered his stepmother. 
He really wished that she changed her opinion about him. She should not any 
longer feel that he was no good. Instead she should know that where people 
with no handicap had failed, he could, despite his handicap, come out a victor. 
That, for him, was the biggest reward he could aspire for. He decided to 
undergo the test not with the hope of marrying a princess. If he married her, 
he would one day be called upon to rule the kingdom. But as a ruler, he 
wouldn’t be able even to hold sword and could not even protect his kingdom, 
so it wouldn’t be wise decision for him to marry her. That’s why he gave up 
his claim to her hand. It was the decision of a wise person." 
Betaal knew that king will definitely speak out the answer so he flew back to 
the ancient tree carrying the corpse along with him. Vikramaditya drew his 
sword and went after the Betaal .
