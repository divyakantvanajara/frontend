                    Once upon a time there was born a beautiful daughter, Mandaravati, to a very 
                    famours priest. When the daughter grew of age, the father was worried about 
                    her marriage.Once, three eligible bachelors came to the father and each asked 
                    him for the hand of the daughter. Each of them threatened to kill himself lest 
                    the daughter be married off to any other of the three. The father decided not to 
                    marry her off to anyone. 
                    One day, she caught a very high pitched fever and died suddenly. All three of 
                    them, grief-struck, cremated the body of Mandaravati. One of them decided to 
                    stay there and slept on the ashes of Mandaravati. The other took her bones and 
                    went to the Ganges. The third became an ascetic and wandered off.

                    On one of his wanderings, the third one reached a brahmin's house. The 
                    brahmin, by power of a spell, was able to bring the dead alive from the ashes. 
                    This was in a book which the brahmin gaurded safely. But the third suitor, in 
                    the stealth of night, stole this book and went back to the cremation ground of 
                    Mandaravati. The second one had returned from the Ganges with the holy 
                    water, and the first one was still there sleeping on the ashes. 
                    Then he with the help of the other two, recited the spell from the book and lo 
                    Behold!! Mandaravati was reborn! Then the three of them started fighting 
                    about whose wife she should be. Each of them claiming the revival being due 
                    to his effort 
                    Betaal stops and asks King Vikram asks this question: Who among the three 
                    suitors should be the husband of Mandaravati? Vikram replies with a lot of 
                    thought, "The person who gave her the life by reciting the spell is her 
                    creator, it could be her father. The person who took her bones to Ganges 
                    shall be her son. But the person who committed himself to the ground and 
                    slept on her ashes out of love, can be her husband." 
                    As soon as Vikram had finished his answer, Betaal disappeared 
                    back to the tree.
