                Vikram again came after him, caught him, put him on his shoulder and started walking. 
                Vikram said angrily - "Why do you deceive me?" Vaitaal said - "I am very happy to see your
                justice, that is why I go back to the tree and celebrate it. Don't be angry, because you 
                are a just King. But I pity you, that you are making untiring efforts without relaxing, as if 
                you wish to achieve something. So just to pass time, listen to this story now." Vaitaal 
                started his story and Vikram started listening.
                Vaitaal said - "Once a king lived in Vardhmaan city. His name was Roopsen. He was very 
                kind and a gracious king. Hearing his praise, once Beerbal named soldier came to his kingdom
                and got very happy to find everything as he heard. One day he came to the palace and 
                desired to see the king. He was taken to the royal court. Beerbal bowed the king and said -
                26
                "Raajan, I am very sad." "Why are you so sad?" Beerbal said - "I am very faithful, I can 
                obey, I can work as a night watchman, but nobody is giving me any work." "Why doesn't 
                anybody give you job?" "Because I demand 100 gold coins daily"
                Hearing this, king also compelled to ponder over the matter, then asked him - "How many 
                members are in your family?" Beerbal said - "We are four, Sir. My wife, one son, one 
                daughter and myself. I served the King Jayasen for many years. He has died now that is 
                why I have come here to serve you." The king asked - "What did he give you?" Beerbal said 
                - "I got 100 gold coins daily." The king said - "But nobody gives so much salary just for 
                nightwatching." Beerbal said - "Even this money is less for my services." The king thought 
                for a while and said to him - "OK, You will stay with me."
                Beerbal got very happy to get the job and all courtiers got very surprised to see the salary 
                of a night watchmen. They started criticizing the King, but the King had already employed 
                him. Beerbal used to keep watch the whole night and take his money in the morning and go 
                away.
                <br>
                One day the king asked his spy to spy on his new employee that what did he do of his 
                money? He reported back, that Beerbal used to give 25 coins to poor, saying "Pray for the 
                King Roopsen, that he should live long." He gave 25 coins in temples and 25 coins to 
                Braahman. He gave 10 coins to widows and orphans, and another 10 coins to lepers and 
                handicapped. The remaining 5 coins he gave to his wife.
                Roopsen got very happy to hear this, so he didn't feel any problem in giving 100 coins to 
                him. He was very happy with Beerbal. Whenever he used to ask "Anybody is there?" Beerbal
                always replied "I am here, Sir."
                <br>
                One day when Roopsen was sleeping comfortably that he woke up hearing the sound of a 
                crying woman. Roopsen called as usual, "Anybody is there?" and Beerbal replied as usual, "I 
                am here, Sir", Roopsen asked him to find out who was that woman who was crying at such a 
                late night time?
                Beerbal proceeded towards the direction from where the sound was coming. It was coming 
                from the cremation ground side, so he came there and saw a woman crying. She was wearing
                many ornaments from tip to toe. She was very beautiful, but there was no tear in her eyes.
                Surprised to see this, Beerbal asked her - "O Beautiful, Why are you crying like this?" She 
                said - "My name is Lakshmee and I live in a royal family, but at this time Shani (Saturn) 
                has attacked on that family. Roopsen's all kingdom will be lost and he will die in a very bad 
                condition, that is why I am crying."

                Hearing this Beerbal asked - "Is there any solution of this problem, so that the King is 
saved." At this she said, "Yes, If somebody can sacrifice his own son with his own hand 
27
then the King can be saved." Beerbal thought and thought and then turned around. 
In the meantime, Roopsen also thought, "Let me see what Beerbal does." so he followed him 
and witnessed all that conversation which took place between Beerbal and Lakshmee. When 
Beerbal returned from there he also followed him.
Beerbal didn't go to the palace, he went straight to his house and told everything to his 
wife. The wife said - "Go and sacrifice our son. This is the opportunity to do our duty 
towards our master." They woke up their son and told him everything, so he also got ready 
to be sacrificed. All went to the Devee temple to sacrifice the son.
<br>
First Beerbal worshipped Devee, then prayed her - "Hey Devee, Please save my king, I give 
you my son to save his life, be pleased with me." And he cut his son's neck with his own 
hand. O Vikram, Seeing this Beerbal's daughter also cut her neck that "when my brother is 
not there, what I will do to live." Beerbal's wife also died in the grief of her children. Now 
Beerbal thought, "My whole family has gone, what I will do in this world?" So he also cut 
his neck. Seeing this Roopsen also could not hold himself, he picked the same sword and cut 
his neck."
After telling this much, Vaitaal got silent. They have come more than half way long. He said
- "Vikram now tell me, whose sacrifice was most valuable - Beerbal's, son's, daughter's, 
wife's or king Roopsen's?"
