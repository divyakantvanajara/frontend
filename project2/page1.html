                Once upon a time there lived a rich brahmin by name of Vishnuswamin, who 
            was performing a huge sacrificial rite. He had three sons who were each very 
            fastidious about three specific things. The eldest was fastidious about food, 
            the second about women and the third about beds. Vishsnuswamin wanted a 
            tortoise for his sacrifice. So he sent his three sons to get one. They did find 
            one but each of them refused to touch it and bring it back home, as each 
            claimed to be as fastidious as the other. 
            Well then to decide, they approached the king with this matter of deciding 
            who among them was the most fastidious. He decided to test them all. He 
            invited the first one, to a very special feast prepared very exquisitely. But the 
            first son, refused to touch the food claiming that the he smelt burnt corpses in 
            the rice. On investigation, the king found that the grains of which the rice was 
            cooked was from a field near a cremation ground. The king was impressed.

            On third occasion, when he was with the third queen, she collpased on the 
            floor on hearing of the sound of a mortar grinding rice, far far away. The king 
            immediately ordered medical attention for her and was surprised too. 
            Since then he took utmost care of his three ultra sensitive queens. 
            Betaal stops and asks King Vikram asks this question: Who among the three 
            queens is the most sensitive? Vikram replies with a lot of thought, "The 
            third one, as she had not even been touched by the light or flower. She had 
            only heard a noise from distance." 
            As soon as Vikram had finished his answer, Betaal disappeared back to the 
            tree.
