                It was a dark night and was raining heavily and there were strange noises from 
every where and voice of the moaning of jackals could be heard. 
Although there was a bad atmosphere king Vikramaditya did not fear a bit. 
He climbed the tree to bring the corpse down and soon he began to walk with 
the corpse lying on his shoulder. 
The Betaal spoke: "O King , I pity you as you are making untiring efforts 
without relaxing as if you wish to achieve something. Instead of enjoying a 
comfortable sleep in your palace you’re still coming after me” 
King didn’t speak anything because any word from his mouth would keep 
Betaal right back on the tree.

                So Betaal starts his story………. 
Once Upon a time there lived a king named Chandrakant. He is very brave 
and kind king. He was taking good care of his subjects. Everyone was living 
with peace in his kingdom. 
Once a guard came to him and told him that “Huzoor! you must alert our 
soldiers, as enemy might attack our country within few days”. Chandrakant 
asked him how could he say before the moment. The guard didn’t reply 
anything. 
Few days went away. Suddenly neighbour country attacked Chandrakant’s 
Kingdom , but as his soldiers were alert. They fought bravely and defeat the 
opponent. Chandrakant remembered the advice of the guard. 
After finishing war he came back to the palace. He was relaxing on his bed at 
the night. He decided to give good reward to the guard next day. 
Next day, he called a guard. Guard came very happily to receive his reward. 
King gave him 1000 gold coins and asked him how you got an idea enemies 
were going to attack on our kingdom

                Guard replied “Sir I can see future 
things which are going to happen in my dreams, that night while doing my 
duty at night I had a dream that enemy was attacking us”. King was pleased 
with him. He gave him 1000 gold coins. But suddenly he said “You have done 
good work by alerting us, but you are dismissed from the post of the guard”. 
People were surprised by King’s decision, but no one had a dare to ask him 
why. But the guard said “Yes sir, I must be punished and went away”. 
Betaal stops and asks King Vikram asks this question: Why King dismissed 
guard even if he helped him to win against the enemy? 
Vikram replies with a lot of thought, "Betaal, duty of guard is to take care of 
palace’s gate. As guard said he said he had a dream during the duty, king got 
the idea he was sleeping at the gate so although he helped him to win against 
enemy he forgot to do his duty so king dismissed him from the post of the 
guard." 
As soon as Vikram had finished his answer, Betaal disappeared back to the 
tree.
