                    Vikram was the name of a king. He ruled over a city on the banks of 
                    Godavari River. He was very famous for his bravery and courage. 
                    People loved him because he always rendered justice. 
                    One day a sage came to the court of Vikram and gifted him a fruit. 
                    The king handed it over to his treasurer. Thereafter, the sage kept 
                    coming to the court daily to gift a fruit to the king. The king could not 
                    understand the reason behind this behaviour. But still he did not try to 
                    find out the sage's intentions. 


                    However, one morning, Vikram noticed a monkey sitting on the 
                    palace wall and gave the fruit to it. The monkey had started eating the 
                    fruit when suddenly a dazzling gem fell out of it. The King was very 
                    surprised. He immediately ordered his treasurer to get him all the  
                    fruits kept in the storage. The fruits had gone bad but when the king 
                    had them crushed, each one of them yielded a precious gem. The 
                    generous King donated all these gems to the poor and waited for the 
                    sageâ€™s visit to the court.
