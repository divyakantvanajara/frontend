                  TALES OF KING VIKRAM AND BETAAL THE VAMPIRE-From
                  Bhavishya Puran
                  Vikram era started in 57 BC by Vikramaditya the Great as a commemoration
                  of his victory upon the Shaks. There is plentiful literature on Vikramaditya, and in the Bhavishya Puran itself there are descriptions of Vikramaditya in more than 40 chapters between Pratisarg Parv I and IV. Pratisarg Parv IV, chapter 1 of Bhavishya Puran says that after the elapse of a full 3,000 years in kaliyug (3102 - 3000 = 102 BC), a dynamic Divine personality was born who was named Vikramaditya. Bhavishya Puran further says that the great King Vikramaditya ruled for one hundred years. When he was only five years old he went into the jungles to worship God. After twelve years, when he came out, God Shiv sent for him a celestial golden throne which was decorated with thirty-two statues. According to the above descriptions Vikramaditya lived for (5 years + 12 years
                  + 100 years) 117 years (102 BC - 15 AD).
                  
                  Kalidas, the greatest poet, writer and the literary figure of his time, living a pious life and sincerely devoted to his scholarly work, was one of the nine gems of King Vikram's court. The "Jyotirvidabharnam" by Kalidas tells in its first cha that Vikram era started at the elapse of (agni 3, ambar 0, yug 4 and ved 4 = 3,0,4,4) 3,044 years of kaliyug. Thus, the 3,045th year of kaliyug was the beginning of Vikram era which is 57 BC. At the end of Jyotirvidabharnam,
                  Mahakavi Kalidas mentions the exact date of his writing and says that
                  in the Kali era 3067 he had started to write this book. It means, he wrote that book when 3,067 years of kaliyug had passed. That comes to 35 BC (3102
                  -	3067 = 35), which is after the beginning of Vikram era. Thus, Vikramaditya was born in 102 BC (3102-3000), established his 'era' in 57 BC and left this earth planet in 15 AD.
                  
                  
                  Captain sir Richard R Burton has translated 11 stories under the caption TALES OF KING VIKRAM AND BETAAL THE VAMPIRE and concluded â€“ In
                  otherwords, to the present day, whenever a Hindu novelist, romancer, or
                   
                  tale writer seeks a peg upon which to suspend the texture of his story, he invariably pitches upon the glorious, pious, and immortal memory of that Eastern Kin Arthur, vikramadita, shortly called vikram.

                  Once upon a time there was a king named Vikramaaditya who ruled Pratisthana on the river Godavari. He was a mighty and glorious king. Everyday when he used to hold public court,a beggar used to come along and present a fruit to the king and this went on for a couple of years when curiosity got the better of the king. The king used to pass on the fruit to his treasurer who used to throw them all in the storage. On hearing of the king's curiosity, the treasurer was surprised to see the storage full of emeralds and pearls and the fruit had disintegrated. He reported this to the king. The king questioned the beggar the next day about this. On hearing this, the beggar requested the help from the king for a magic spell he was going to perform. The king was asked to meet him at nightfall of the fourteenth night of the dark moon near the cremation ground. The king did as told and found the beggar there. The beggar was drawing a magic circle and all around were the howling noises of vampires, ghosts and other nightly creatures. The beggar asked the king to go further deep into the woods and bring the corpse, which was haging upside down on a tree.
                  The king found the corpse for sure, but as he started lifting it and taking it down he realised that it was possessed by a vampire. Everytime the king talked the vampire jumped back the tree. In the end, the king jumped up sliently and brought the corpse down. The vampire then started telling him a story. In the end of the story, he asked a puzzle to the king related to story. As soon as the king finished his answer, he fled back to the top of the tree. This happened 24 times. But for the 25th time, the question was so tough that the king could not answer. These 25 stories are very famous in Indian literature, known as Vikram- Betaal tales. On the end of the 25th tale, the vampire cautioned the king that the beggar would ask him to rest on a piece of wood when he would be sacrificed. In that situation the vampire asked the king to let the beggar show the way and asked the king to get rid of the evil beggar. So did the king. And
                   <br>
                   <br>
                  the vampire granted the king for a boon. The king requested that the stories whichever were told to him, be told time and again in history and wherever these stories are told vampires would not dare. Hence the famous Vikram-Betaal stories.
                  As a sample, here we present the last of the stories, which the king could not answer. Betaal said,
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  
                  "Once there was a king in the South who had lot of relatives. The relatives were always hungry after the throne. So once they usurped the throne, and the king had to flee the kingdom with his wife and daughter. They travelled through dense forests. In one area which was occupied by barbarians, he adivsed his wife and daughter to hide behind a bush while he fought the robbers but died a tragic death. The queen and the daughter wept for their king.
                  In the meantime, a peasent and his son came to the forest on horses. They saw the foorprints of the ladies, and were impressed. The son decided to marry the lady with the smaller feet while the father decided to marry the lady with the bigger feet. Upon a distance they saw the queen and the daughter. The peasent talked smoothly with the ladies and consoled them and heard their story after convincing them that they were not robbers. The peasant and the son then brought the two ladies home and told them of the plan of marriage. They consented. But alas, the bigger feet belonged to the daugher and the smaller feet belonged to the mother. So the son married the mother and the father married the daughter.
                  Betaal then asks this question: How are the children born on both the sides related to one another?
                  Vikram was speechless as he could not get any satisfactory answer. So the Betaal could not escape this time.
