                This time Vikram got very angry with him. He again came after him, caught 
                him, put him on his shoulder and started walking. Vikram said angrily - "You 
                34
                deceive me, Vaitaal? I will cut your head. Why do you run all the time?" 
                Vaitaal first didn't say anything, but after a while he said - "Why are you so 
                angry?" Vikram said - "Why do you run away?" I run because of your correct 
                answer. What was our condition? Do you remember? That you will not speak at 
                all." Vikram said - "But when you talk about justice, then I have to speak. 
                You know that it is my nature." Vaitaal said - "Then running away is my 
                nature." and he laughed heartily. "OK Listen now, I tell you a story just to 
                pass time." Vaitaal started his story and Vikram listened quietly.
                Vaitaal said - "This time the story is very strange, and you have to tell me 
                the correct judgment, otherwise your head will split and scattered away in 
                pieces, you know that. This is my Shaap to you " Vikram nodded silently.
                Vaitaal started - "Once upon a time, there lived a rich man in Avanteepur. His 
                name was Gunvant. He was very religious. His wife was very beautiful but was 
                very wicked. She gave birth to a daughter who was from some other man, and 
                that is why she was more beautiful. After some time she grew up and became 
                like her mother. Her name was Ratnaavatee. Her father started looking a boy 
                for her, but in the meantime, she had illegal relations with her servant. 
                Hearing this Gunvant sacked his servant. He went away and started living at 
                another place.
                But Ratnaavatee still continued to see him. She used to go in night and come 
                back in night. Only her mother knew about this affair. In the meantime 
                Gunvant had searched a good match for her and married her to him. Thus she 
                went to live with her husband, but she could not break her relationship with 
                her servant. She took her maid in confidence and continued to visit him in the 
                night. The maid helped her brother also to meet Ratnaavatee.
                After a while her husband came to know about this, he sacked the maid. Now 
                it had been difficult for Ratnaavatee to meet her lover, but one night she got 
                this chance. She went there and told him the story. He advised her that she 
                should wait for sometime, and when the situation is better, she might come 
                again. Her husband knew everything, so he managed to give that servant 
                poison. He took the poison mixed with food and slept. In sleep, he died. On 
                the same night, Ratnaavatee went to meet him.

                On the way a thief saw an ornament-laden woman going in dark, so he 
followed her. When she had entered in the servant's house, he watched her 
35
from hiding. Now, under whichever tree the thief was standing, a Vaitaal lived 
on that tree. He also saw Ratnaavatee going inside the house and fell in love 
with her instantly. He thought why shouldn't he enter the servant's body and 
enjoy with Ratnaavatee. So he entered the dead body of the servant. 
Ratnaavatee had come to him. She met with her lover. In excitement he bit 
her nose with his teeth. After biting her, Vaitaal went out of the servant's 
body, but the piece of her nose still remained in his dead body's mouth.
Ratnaavatee cried with pain. Besides she saw her lover dead. Seeing her lover 
dead, Ratnaavatee got confused and ran away from there. The thief was also 
watching, he also got frightened. He didn't leave Ratnaavatee, he still 
followed her. Ratnaavatee came back to her own house and started crying in 
front of her husband's room. Her husband got up, his other family members 
also got up. She said that her husband had bit her nose. Ratnaavatee's 
husband was giving explanations but nobody was listening to him
The matter went to king's soldiers. Ratnaavatee and her husband were 
presented in king's court. There she blamed her husband for her bitten nose. 
The king got angry and ordered to hang her husband. When the thief heard 
this, he went to the king and told him everything and said - "If you will see 
the dead body's mouth, you will find the piece of her bitten nose in his 
mouth." The king sent his people there, and indeed they found the piece in his 
mouth. The king released Ratnaavatee's husband, and expelled Ratnaavatee 
after shaving her head.
Vaitaal said - "Now you do justice, who was at fault, and who stayed on his 
good path?" Vikram didn't reply. Seeing him silent, Vaitaal said to him - "OK, 
I tell you another story. In Indraapur named city lived a very rich religious 
man named Mahaadhan. He had a son whose name was Shreedhan. He was 
very wicked. Fed up with his wickedness, Mahaadhan had expelled him from 
his house so he went to Chandra Nagar.
There lived a rich man named Hemgun whose daughter Chandramukhee was 
very beautiful. Hemgun was in the process of searching a good boy for her, 
and Shreedhan was in search of money. 
One day he disguised as a poor and went to Hemgun and told that he was 
robbed by robbers while he was going for trading. Now he doesn't have a 
single penny. The rich man pitied him and let him stay in his palace. Hemgun 
36
told everything to his wife. His wife thought why not they should marry their 
daughter to him. She told this to her husband, the man liked the proposal and 
he talked to Shreedhan.
